# PCI Format

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template alxsimon/typst-pci
```

This will install the format extension and create an example qmd file
that you can use as a starting place for your document.

## To Do

- [ ] Properly handle authors and affiliations
- [ ] Wait for pandoc 3.1.12 to be integrated in quarto for the in-text citation to work
- [ ] Follow development in typst to have line numbers
- [ ] Simplify the front page for PCI template
- [ ] Make two options PCI/PCJ for submission to PCI and upload to PCJ (PCJ should be simplified so that the automatic formatting can be applied)
- [ ] Document how to use the template
